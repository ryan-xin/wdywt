# WDYWT - What do you wear today

### Overview ###

WDYWT is a social media platform for sneakerheads to share what sneakers they wear everyday. I use Instagram as the reference. There are many similar features on this web app.

WDYWT is my second project at General Assembly. It's built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, Heroku, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and some ruby libraries.

### Acknowledgements ###

* COC - Convention Over Configuration;
* DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself;
* MVC - Model, View and Controller is hard to understand at first. Several files need to be edited at the same time. Still need more practive;
* I created several models in this project(User, Post, Comment, Like, Follow), which is a good opportunity to learn CRUD;
* I only use Cloudinary for image upload in this project. It worth doing more research on this platform and using it in the next project.
